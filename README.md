# SCAN-Symbiota-insect-pin-label-generator

A Jupyter notebook, <symbiota_label_printer.ipynb>, uses Python 3 to generate insect pin labels for a set of specimen records downloaded from the University of Guam Insect Collection online catalog stored on the SCAN Symbiota portal.
As an initial test, we download records and generate labels for insects collected by Benita Laird-Hopkins during her seed predation study.
